# Chapter 1 Linear Regression Project

This repository contains Python implementations of linear regression algorithms discussed in Chapter 1 of the CS229 course, including batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and the normal equation. The goal is to reinforce concepts such as cost functions, gradient descent, probabilistic interpretation, and convexity.

## Files

- `linear_regression.py`: A Python module that implements linear regression using batch gradient descent and the normal equation.
- `README.md`: Overview and instructions.

## Running the Code

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install dependencies (e.g., numpy) using pip.
3. Run `python linear_regression.py` to execute example training on a toy dataset.

## Concepts Covered

- Hypothesis representation  
- Squared error cost function  
- Gradient descent update rule  
- Normal equation  
- Probabilistic interpretation of least squares  
- Locally weighted linear regression (optional)

Feel free to explore and modify the code to gain a deeper understanding of linear regression.
